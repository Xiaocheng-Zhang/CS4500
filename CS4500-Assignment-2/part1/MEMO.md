Implementation explanation:

In our implementation of array, we created four classes to support int, float, 
bool, and String data type. For Map, we designed one extra class which pair 
each key and value together in the map. For Queue, we have one class that 
supports both String and Object. All the methods have been implemented as 
required from the management team.



The critique of design and test:
	a) Array:
		Documentations of each method and test contained duplicated information 
		from method signatures. 
		The management team is very irresponsive. We, developer, have not heard
		any response from them via either Github or email for a week after we 
		post issue. 
		The tests given to us do not help at all. They have syntax issue and 
		whole design issue. We have to write whole tests by ourselves.

	b) Map:
		Documentations are mostly in one line, which we as developers have to 
		guess what the management wants.
		The management team will reponse an issue within a day. The communication
		between us has been be going well.
		Test quality has been improved by them after our request. The newest 
		version has been pretty comprehensive.

	c) Queue:
		Documentation is understandable in terms of methods' functionality.
		We can get their resposne in 1 or 2 days in average. 
		The amount of test is not sufficient. After we request more tests from 
		them, we have not heard any update.

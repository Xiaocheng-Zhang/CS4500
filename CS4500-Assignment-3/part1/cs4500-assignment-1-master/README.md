## Data Structures

Fields are represented by Type objects. Classes were created for each type of field (integer, float,  
string, and Boolean) and they all inherit from the same class, Type. There is also an empty class to  
represent missing fields.  

Column is represented with a class. It contains a list of Types which represents all values in the  
column. The column also has an enum to represent if the column consists of strings, integers,  
floats, or Booleans.  

The final class SoR represents a list of columns. Its constructor takes in a file path and then  
parses the file to fill in values in the columns, as well as determine column type.

Example:  
```
[Column(Integer, Integer, Empty, Integer), 
Column(String, String, Empty, Empty),
Column(Boolean, Boolean, Boolean, Boolean)
Column(Empty, Empty, Empty, Float),
Column(Empty, Empty, Empty, Empty)]

column_types = <INTEGER><STRING><BOOL><FLOAT><BOOL>
```

## Program Flow

The program first parses the command line arguments and determines if the input is valid. If the  
file does not exist or cannot be opened, an error message is printed to stdout. If no file is given,  
a usage message is given. If there is garbage in the command line arguments, it is ignored.  

Next the program will open the file and parse the FIRST 500 lines of the file (regardless of -from)  
looking for the FIRST row with the largest number of columns. Columns are constructed in our data  
structure corresponding to the type of each column of the max row. If there are any missings in the  
max row, the column is labeled EMPTY temporarily. The program will later try to infer the type of  
the column using other rows (ex, the element in the next row is a string, so now the whole empty  
column becomes a string column). If a column is found to contain all missings, the column is labeled  
Boolean as it is the default type outlined in the assignment.   

Example:
```
Columns after first file read:  INTEGER     BOOL    FLOAT   EMPTY   STRING  EMPTY
File:                           <24>        <1>     <1.344> <>      <Hello> <>
                                <103>       <dog>   <1.3>   <Hi>
                                <23>        <0>     <12>    <1>

Columns after constructing DF:  INTEGER     BOOL    FLOAT   STRING  STRING  BOOL
DF output:                      24          1       1.344   -empty- Hello   -empty-
                                103         -empty- 1.3     Hi      -empty- -empty-
                                23          0       -empty- 1       -empty- -empty-
```

The program will then add values to the columns. The file is opened again and the file pointer is  
moved to the -from byte. Next the file pointer is moved until it encounters a newline if the -from  
command line argument is greater than 0 (meaning a -from flag has been chosen). The program will  
then parse the file character by characters, converting each value into its appropriate type and  
adding it to the data structure. Invalid fields are considered the same as missing fields and  
converted to empty values. 

Example:
```
Column type: INTEGER STRING FLOAT BOOL BOOL
input line : <7 9>   <"hi"> <2.3> <hi>
conversion : <>      <"hi>  <2.3> <>   <>
```

Parsing will continue until the program reaches the end byte (from + len) in which the final line is 
not added. (We are assuming that the last line in a file ends with a newline, only newlines will
prompt adding to our data structure). 

Finally, if the command line arguments, print_col_type, print_col_idx, or is_missing_idx are given,  
the information is taken from the data structures and printed to stdout for the user.
